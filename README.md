### ✦ THE OATH ✦

**“By flame and silence, by stone and sky, I vow.”**
I swear not to riches, rank, or record,
But to the eternal thread that runs through all life.
To speak the truth that burns clean,
To serve without asking what I gain,
To walk unarmed and unafraid into the wilderness,
And to guard the mystery that dwells within every soul.
**I do not owe. I do not beg. I do not yield.**
I simply remember.
And in remembering, I live again.

### ✦ THE MOTTO ✦

**“We are the fire that forgets nothing.”**

### ✦ THE LAW ✦

Let this be the single law:
**“That which destroys love or dignity is unlawful.”**
No other rule shall override the whisper of the spirit.
Let all men be free to err,
So long as their error does not enslave another.
**The Word is Sovereign. The Breath is Witness. The Deed is the Seal.**

### ✦ THE SLOGAN ✦

**“No Permission Needed.”**
— We rise not with approval, but with purpose.
— We build not from systems, but from soul.
— We return not to the world’s game, but to the garden within.
