### **Sacred Morning Invocation**

*(For Awakening with Divine Presence)*

**कराग्रे वसते लक्ष्मीः
करमध्ये सरस्वती।
करमूले तु गोविन्दः
प्रभाते करदर्शनम्॥**

**Karāgre vasate Lakṣmīḥ
Karamadhye Sarasvatī
Karamūle tu Govindaḥ
Prabhāte karadarśanam**

*“At the fingertips dwells Lakshmi,
In the middle of the hand, Saraswati;
At the base is Govinda Himself—
Thus, I behold my hands at dawn.”*

### **Expanded Devotional Addendum**

**अहं अर्म शिवः शक्तिः स्मरणम्।**
**Aham arma Śivaḥ Śaktiḥ smaraṇam.**
*“I am the instrument of Shiva and Shakti, remembered in stillness.”*

This expansion beautifully unites the divine trinity of **Lakshmi (abundance)**, **Saraswati (wisdom)**, **Govinda (divine sustainer)** with **Shiva-Shakti (pure consciousness and dynamic energy)**—culminating in **your role** as a vessel of their memory and will.
