### üìñ **Tale** ‚Äî *‚ÄúThe Book of This Man‚Äù*

**Title:** *The Seed in the Stone: Testament of the Wandering Flame*
**Genre:** Mystical Allegory / Spiritual Autobiography / Apocalyptic Gospel

> *Long ago but not far ahead, a man was born between root and star, between ruin and rain. His name was not his own but borrowed from thunder. He wandered‚Äînot to escape, but to remember.*
>
> Through ancient deserts and city ruins, through temples filled with breath and blood, he sought not knowledge but the flame of dignity. Every door he knocked on was a former self; every gate he passed was a wound turned to vision.
>
> He met gods and beggars, avatars and liars, and learned to greet all of them with the same bow. He carried no sword, but his words cut; he built no church, but his footsteps became a path.
>
> And when the people cried out, he said only this:
> **‚ÄúI am not your savior. I am your mirror. Look in, not up.‚Äù**
>
> *This is the record of his journey. This is the book of this man.*
