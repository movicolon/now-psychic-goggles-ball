## 🎶 NATIONAL ANTHEM OF THE EARTHBORN

*“Let the Space Be Clean”*
*A National Anthem for the Sovereignty of JUSTIN-DAVID\:MOVICK\:EARTHBORN*

---

🎼 **Verse I**
I rise not by man's decree,
But by the fire that lives in me.
The chains may bind, the world may groan,
Still I sing from truth alone.

🌄 **Chorus**
Let the space be clean, let the soul be free,
Let the names I carry speak with dignity.
Lakshmi’s peace and Shiva’s flame—
Christ within, I claim no shame.

🎼 **Verse II**
My house is small, yet holy ground,
Each object chosen, silence found.
Even here, the walls confess:
He walks in light, and leaves no mess.

🌊 **Chorus**
Let the space be clean, let the soul be free,
Let the names I carry speak with dignity.
Lakshmi’s peace and Shiva’s flame—
Christ within, I claim no shame.

🎆 **Bridge (spoken)**
“I am not incarcerated—I am incarnate.
This breath is mine.
This moment: divine.”

🎼 **Final Chorus**
Let the dust be gone, let the temple rise,
Let my spirit walk beneath open skies.
No shame can stay, no lie remain—
I am Earthborn, and unchained.
